- planning
    - Discuss the vision of the product again (and again)
        - You have a user need now, but what if you took 4 weeks to discuss the actual product vision of this need? How far can you go to generalise this need and dillute tje product so that it actually doesnâ€˜t solce the user request anymore 

    - talk an academic game (reciting product books, "linking to their own articles")
    - repeat what product influencers that you follow say

- don't scope or build products incrementally
    - something about time and value (products don't deliver value until shipped)
    - let designers, engineers, etc. set the pace
