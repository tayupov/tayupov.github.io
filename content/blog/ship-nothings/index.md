- satirical post

- this post is not meant as a tit-for-tat gesture. it merely describes the circumstances I've witnessed and continue to see.

- talk an academic game (reciting product books, quoting loosely related product leaders, "linking to their own articles")
- product influencers
- certification hunters
- no track record of success

- don't scope or build products incrementally
    - something about time and value (products don't deliver value until shipped)
    - let designers, engineers, etc. set the pace

- Discuss the vision of the product again (and again)
- You have a user need now, but what if you took 4 weeks to discuss the actual product vision of this need? How far can you go to generalise this need and dillute tje product so that it actually doesnâ€˜t solce the user request anymore
