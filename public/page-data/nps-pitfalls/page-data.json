They're overseeing many products these days and suggest you go for a metric they're familiar with - the ol' reliable Net Promoter Score (NPS).</p>\n<p>You start drafting the survey, but hold up - there are some things you should know first.</p>\n<h3>What is NPS?</h3>\n<p>NPS stands for Net Promoter Score, a metric used to measure customer satisfaction with products. First developed in 2003 by Bain and Company, it has gained popularity among business executives and is considered a widely used instrument for measuring customer loyalty.</p>\n<p>It measures customer satisfaction, based on a simple question:</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/701254d8f49f1d50f0c6129496c18f1a/a8c87/nps-question.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 22.78481012658228%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"NPS Question\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/701254d8f49f1d50f0c6129496c18f1a/f058b/nps-question.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/701254d8f49f1d50f0c6129496c18f1a/c26ae/nps-question.png 158w,\n/static/701254d8f49f1d50f0c6129496c18f1a/6bdcf/nps-question.png 315w,\n/static/701254d8f49f1d50f0c6129496c18f1a/f058b/nps-question.png 630w,\n/static/701254d8f49f1d50f0c6129496c18f1a/40601/nps-question.png 945w,\n/static/701254d8f49f1d50f0c6129496c18f1a/78612/nps-question.png 1260w,\n/static/701254d8f49f1d50f0c6129496c18f1a/a8c87/nps-question.png 3265w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<em>NPS Question</em></p>\n<p>Respondents give a rating from 0 (not likely at all) to 10 (very likely) and depending on their response fall into one of 3 categories:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"markdown\"><pre class=\"language-markdown\"><code class=\"language-markdown\">üòª <span class=\"token bold\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">**</span><span class=\"token content\">Promoters</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">**</span></span>\nScore (9-10) are loyal customers who will keep using\nour product and fuel growth by referring others.\n\nüòê <span class=\"token bold\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">**</span><span class=\"token content\">Passives</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">**</span></span>\nScore (7-8) are not recommending a product,\nbut are also unlikely to damage it with negative word of mouth.\n\nüòæ <span class=\"token bold\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">**</span><span class=\"token content\">Detractors</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">**</span></span>\nScores (0-6) are unlikely to recommend a product\nto others, won‚Äôt stick around or repeat purchases,\nand‚Äîworse‚Äîcould discourage potential customers</code></pre></div>\n<p>Calculating your NPS score is easy - subtract the (relative) number of detractors from the number of promoters. If 80% of respondents are promoters and 10% are detractors, then your score is 70.</p>\n<p>Net Promoter Score is always expressed as a number from -100 to 100; the score is negative when a company has more detractors than promoters, and positive in the opposite situation. Creators of NPS, Bain &#x26; Company, suggest: Above 0 is good. Above 20 is favorable. Above 50 is excellent.</p>\n<h3>Pitfalls</h3>\n<p>Measuring customer satisfaction with NPS falls flat in many situations. Before choosing and relying on it, consider the following pitfalls.</p>\n<h4>Improving over time</h4>\n<p>Because NPS defines score ranges for detractors very wide (0-6), you miss measuring the improvements you make over time to your product.</p>\n<p>Consider the following survey responses over time:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th align=\"center\">Survey 1 (Q1)</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Survey 2 (Q2)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>User 1</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>User 2</td>\n<td align=\"center\">1</td>\n<td align=\"center\">5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>User 3</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>User 4</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2</td>\n<td align=\"center\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>User 5</td>\n<td align=\"center\">2</td>\n<td align=\"center\">3</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The score for both surveys equals -100. There is a clear improvement in survey results from quarter to quarter (Q1 avg=2; Q2 avg=4), but all respondents still fall into the (0-6) detractor category.</p>\n<p>NPS is blind to any improvements you make over time for users who are not satisfied with your product. This can be especially infuriating if you were to launch a new product, that finds little success initially. Until your users consistently give you scores of 9-10, NPS is not a valuable metric for you.</p>\n<h4>Promotion as a proxy for success</h4>\n<p>How the NPS question is phrased implies that users will or will not recommend it. It ignores the actual satisfaction customers feel with the product or service.</p>\n<p>It becomes obvious when you consider that not all products are discussed extensively among peers (or friends and family).</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/c94a8ba9e934a826ce55500e230ceda9/8740f/windows10.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 74.0506329113924%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Windows 10\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/c94a8ba9e934a826ce55500e230ceda9/f058b/windows10.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/c94a8ba9e934a826ce55500e230ceda9/c26ae/windows10.png 158w,\n/static/c94a8ba9e934a826ce55500e230ceda9/6bdcf/windows10.png 315w,\n/static/c94a8ba9e934a826ce55500e230ceda9/f058b/windows10.png 630w,\n/static/c94a8ba9e934a826ce55500e230ceda9/40601/windows10.png 945w,\n/static/c94a8ba9e934a826ce55500e230ceda9/8740f/windows10.png 1106w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span>\n<em>Microsoft Windows 10 NPS Survey</em></p>\n<p>Although discussions about recommending operating systems are a lot more common than this respondent might realize (ask any Linux user), it's still common to send NPS surveys when the intended growth mechanism of a product doesn't align.</p>\n<p>I would argue that NPS is measuring <em>loyalty</em> instead of satisfaction. It forces customers to take a much wider view of the brand and product, rather than their overall feeling of satisfaction. If you want to measure satisfaction you can use <a href=\"https://delighted.com/what-is-customer-satisfaction-score\">CSAT</a>.</p>\n<h4>Overreliance on a single metric</h4>\n<p>This should go without saying, but over-relying on NPS to make decisions is probably not a good idea. Bain &#x26; Company, creators of NPS, claim it <a href=\"https://www.bain.com/consulting-services/customer-strategy-and-marketing/net-promoter-score-system/\">predicts overall company growth and customer lifetime value</a>, but this is just overselling their invention. The <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200716065914/https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/dfe0/4f3d83fee37a617d9cacfebc331605dc4bfc.pdf\">relationship between NPS and company growth</a> has long been questioned by scholars.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"https://adevinta.com/\">Adevinta</a> we recently started measuring developer experience in a company-wide survey. I cannot overstate enough, how difficult it is to effectively measure satisfaction. Developer experience has too many aspects to summarise in a single metric.</p>\n<p>The way I see it, NPS became popular because it's an easy-to-digest metric for executives and it trivializes product-market dynamics. NPS is valuable, but it should be complemented with other metrics for a comprehensive understanding of customer satisfaction.</p>\n<p>The goal should be about telling a compelling story of customer satisfaction, from many perspectives, captivating and with clear next steps to take.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"NPS Pitfalls","date":"December 07, 2023","description":"NPS is a popular metric to measure customer satisfaction.
